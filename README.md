# Poze-AMES 🧪🧠

**Explaining Ames Mutagenicity: A Hybrid GNN–DNN Approach to Prediction and Feature Interpretation**

Poze-AMES is a deep learning framework for **Ames mutagenicity prediction** that combines **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** with **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)**.  
The model leverages molecular graph representations to achieve strong predictive performance while providing **interpretable feature-level explanations**, which are crucial for cheminformatics and drug discovery workflows.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Create and Activate the Conda Environment

```bash
conda env create -f env.yml -n Poze-AMES
conda activate Poze-AMES
```

Verify:
```bash
python --version
```

---

### 2️⃣ Add the Environment as a Jupyter Kernel

This step is required to run the notebooks correctly.

```bash
conda activate Poze-AMES

python -m ipykernel install \
  --user \
  --name Poze-AMES \
  --display-name "Python (Poze-AMES)"
```

Check that the kernel is registered:
```bash
jupyter kernelspec list
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Notebooks

1. Start Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
# or
jupyter lab
```

2. Open a notebook from the `notebooks/` directory  
3. Select the kernel:
```
Kernel → Change Kernel → Python (Poze-AMES)
```
